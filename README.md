# orderbook

I used CLion IDE to edit and compile. Since it uses cmake, you can compile it without having to install CLion.
On Mac, go to a directory where you want to create the `orderbook/` directory, and run

```
git clone https://github.com/c-s/orderbook.git
cmake .
```
If your cmake is old, run

```
brew install cmake
```
to get at least 3.5.
